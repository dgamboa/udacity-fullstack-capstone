# Kane Films | Executive Producers

This is a simple application API for managing movie and actor records in a PostgreSQL database. I built it from scratch as the capstone project for [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com/) [Full Stack nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044).

The primary objective of the project is to demonstrate proficiency with the full stack skills developed throughout the nanodegree - mainly, database build out, manipulation and interactions; API endpoint structuring, testing and error handling; authentication with third party systems, roles and permissions; testing with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and deployment with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

The [Kane Films](https://kane-films-capstone.herokuapp.com/) application consists of a database that contains movie and actor records accessible via RESTful endpoints.  At this point the project doesn't have a browser-based frontend and requests are best sent and received via [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html). The endpoints allow authenticated users to create, read, updated and delete movies and actors depending on their permission level. Authentication is handled via JWT tokens and managed through [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).
