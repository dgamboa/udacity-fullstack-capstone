# Kane Films | Executive Producers

This is a simple application API for managing movies and actors. I built it from scratch as the capstone project for [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com/) [Full Stack nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044).

The primary objective of the project is to demonstrate proficiency with the full stack skillsets developed throughout the nanodegree - mainly, database build out, manipulation and interactions; API endpoint structuring, testing and error handling; authentication with third party systems, roles and permissions; deployment with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and testing with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

The films application consists of a movies and actors database accessible via RESTful endpoints through JSON-structured calls and responses via [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html). The endpoints allow authenticated users to create, read, updated and delete movies and actors depending on their permission level. Authentication is handled via JWT tokens and managed through [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).
